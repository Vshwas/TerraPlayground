what is terraform ?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

✅ Key Features of Terraform:

    Declarative Language: Define what the infrastructure should look like, and Terraform will handle the provisioning.

    Provider Support: Integrates with cloud providers like Azure, AWS, GCP, and many others.

    State Management: Maintains a state file to track infrastructure changes.

    Execution Plan: Shows what actions will be taken before applying changes.

    Resource Graph: Creates a dependency graph to determine the optimal execution order.

    Modules: Reusable, self-contained configurations that can be shared and managed.

✅  Use Cases:

    Provisioning VMs, networks, and storage in Azure.

    Deploying managed databases, Kubernetes clusters, and serverless functions.

    Automating infrastructure scaling and modifications.
